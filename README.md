## Currency Exchange Rates

### Overview

This application offers support for real-time currency exchange rates. This feature is disabled by default. To enable it, you must first register for an API key at [ExchangeRate-API](https://www.exchangerate-api.com/). The application uses this service due to its generous provision of up to 1,500 free API calls per month, which should be enough for development and testing purposes.

**Disclaimer**: There is no affiliation between this application and ExchangeRate-API.

Once you have your API key, you can enable the feature by setting the `CURRENCY_API_KEY` environment variable in your `.env` file.

### Configuration

Of course, you may use any service you wish to retrieve currency exchange rates. If you decide to use a different service, you can update the `config/services.php` file with your choice:

```php
'currency_api' => [
    'key' => env('CURRENCY_API_KEY'),
    'base_url' => 'https://v6.exchangerate-api.com/v6',
],
```

Additionally, you may update the following method in the `app/Services/CurrencyService.php` file which is responsible for retrieving the exchange rates:

```php
public function getExchangeRates($base)
{
    $api_key = config('services.currency_api.key');
    $base_url = config('services.currency_api.base_url');

    $req_url = "{$base_url}/{$api_key}/latest/{$base}";

    $response = Http::get($req_url);

    if ($response->successful()) {
        $responseData = $response->json();
        if (isset($responseData['conversion_rates'])) {
            return $responseData['conversion_rates'];
        }
    }

    return null;
}
```

### Important Information

- To use the currency exchange rate feature, you must first obtain an API key from a service provider. This application is configured to use a service that offers a free tier suitable for development and testing purposes.
- Your API key is sensitive information and should be kept secret. Do not commit it to your repository or share it with anyone.
- Note that API rate limits may apply depending on the service you choose. Make sure to review the terms for your chosen service.
